## Editing
This template has the ability to edit, and automatically save, inside the browser!

In most browsers, you can use `Command/CTRL + B/I` to make text bold or italic.

There are also two types of returns, `Shift + Enter`, which adds a `<br>` within the current element

And `Enter`, which is somewhat contextual. If focused after the last character, it can be used to append list elements
